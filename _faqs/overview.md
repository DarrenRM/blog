### Why do we need decentralized names on the internet?
DNS today is not secure and vulnerable to DDoS attacks. Compromised certificate authorities threaten SSL. Billions of dollars in cryptocurrency are currently being moved around on potentially insecure websites. If you’re personally identifiable as the owner of a valuable asset, there’s a risk to your personal safety. Anonymised registration would end the risk of being held for ransom.

### How is Handshake different from other decentralized naming projects? 
Some naming projects were too early. The systems do not allow for secure “light clients” (simple payment verification mode), so one must run a full-node, equivalent to saving all the domains in the world on your computer. Also, prior efforts didn’t pre-reserve names for existing stakeholders.

In contrast, Handshake creates a shared investment on time and interest that represents support in the project. We make certificate authorities obsolete and secure SSL. With our robust technology, name lookup is faster than regular DNS (2msec/JJ). Handshake is more resilient to DDoS attacks and makes censorship exceptionally difficult because of the blockchain. We are not replacing domain names, but your username for the entire internet and secure services on top of that. Also, the top 100,000 pre-reserved names will be given to existing rights holders (e.g. Apple and Google) to prevent name squatting. 

### Why is Handshake distributing coins to open source developers? 
We want to establish the means whereby open source developers can provide a gift to the world. The handshake blockchain will start with an initial supply of 1.36 billion coins, of which 77.5% will be distributed to open source developers. [add more about social incentives]

### Why should I trust a new blockchain project with critical internet naming?
Firstly, Handshake will initially work alongside the current domain name system, co-existing with the root zone. The most visited 100,000 top level domains will be reserved for existing name holders, so we will support users who want to preserve their conventional DNS.

Crucially, Handshake has clear advantages over the traditional naming and signature systems. Using the Handshake blockchain means avoiding the security vulnerabilities of conventional DNS, which include DDoS attacks on name servers and cache poisoning.
