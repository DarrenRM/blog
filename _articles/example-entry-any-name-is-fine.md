To start, it will be a simple command-line interface for the name buying and auction process. 

For technical users, they can do bidding directly by interacting with the blockchain using the auction mechanism. Users are in full control and responsible for maintaining their keys. 

For non technical users, websites/services would arise where they register and participate in the decentralized auction system on your behalf, similar to going to godaddy.com and registering there. The service would bid on your behalf and after they win the auction, they would maintain the keys for you.

All possible names are released weekly over the first year after launch. People can put in blinded bids any time after. After the first bid, everyone else can place bids, after one week bidding is closed. Everyone who bids have 1 week to reveal their bid price. After that second week, a winner is chosen. The losers get their coins back, and the winner receives the name with their coins being permanently removed from the system (“burned coins”). 

If one owns a name directly, the current recipient can give the destination address/key of the new recipient. They create a transaction to send the domain to someone else and is minded in a block on the blockchain. After a week, the transaction is confirmed and the transfer is locked in. This transaction transferring ownership can also have payments embedded so that the recipient will receive coins if and only if the transfer is successful (this means that one does not need to use 3rd party escrow to pay for transfer).

The largest challenge is the “key exchange problem.” This can be solved by putting the certificate and names on the blockchain.
