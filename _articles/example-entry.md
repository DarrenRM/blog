We believe in social good being a motivating factor. Our commitment to the free and open source software community is absolute. Instead of enrichening ourselves, we’ve taken the validation value from this project and shared it with the world.

Building a new DNS for the world is not something any one organization can do on its own - that’s why we’re giving away all $10.2m we’ve raised from investors to well-known open source organizations and developers, including Mozilla, Open Rights Group, and the Apache Foundation.

If your open source project isn’t a non profit, don’t worry! You can still benefit by participating in our FOSS community airdrop. Handshake coins are being distributed now.
